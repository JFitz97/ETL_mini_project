# ETL_mini_project
For this project I practiced extracting, transforming, and loading data from a provided source into a SQL database. The raw dataset contained information on crowdfunding campaigns in csv files. Using these files, I made 4 different DataFrames (Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contacts) which involved cleaning and restructuring the data. This work can be found in the "ETL_Mini_Project.ipynb" file. Then, I made a crowdfunding database using PostgreSQL with the schema found in "crowdfunding_db_schema.sql". I imported the information from my dataframes into the database, and displayed these tables in the "database_screenshots" folder.
